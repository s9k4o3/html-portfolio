<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I’m Saurabh Kumar. I’m passionate about football and spend a lot of my
  free time on the field. There’s nothing quite like the thrill of a
  well-executed play or the camaraderie with my teammates. Football isn’t just a
  game for me; it’s a way to stay active, challenge myself, and have fun.
</p>

<p>
  When I’m not playing football, you’ll likely find me immersed in mathematics.
  I’ve always had a strong affinity for numbers and problem-solving, which makes
  studying math both exciting and rewarding. I enjoy tackling complex equations
  and exploring mathematical theories—they keep my mind sharp and engaged.
</p>

<p>
  I also have a keen interest in finance and the stock market. Analyzing market
  trends, understanding investment strategies, and following economic
  developments fascinate me. I love diving into the intricacies of trading and
  financial planning, and I’m constantly learning more to improve my skills and
  knowledge in this area.
</p>
<p>
  Balancing these passions—football, math, and finance—keeps me motivated and
  fulfilled. Each aspect of my life complements the others, and together they
  shape who I am and drive me to pursue my goals with enthusiasm.
